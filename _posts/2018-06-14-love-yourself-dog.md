## Imagination

If you imagine yourself as lovable as your dog, you will be happier. Your dog is always excited when you get home. They wag their tail and jump excitedly at you. When you get close to the leash, they are already halfway to the door.  They love you no matter what. By imagining yourself as lovable as your dog, you create happiness for yourself. Love yourself as much as your dog loves you.

## Live in the moment

Your dog loves you unconditionally. Your dog does not constantly put you down; they lift you up. They do not judge you for your past mistakes, and they do not worry about your future. Try to explain the concept of tomorrow to your dog and they will stare at you and smile. Dogs live in the moment. You can learn a lot from your dog and release some anxiety by also living in the moment. Become aware of your breathing. Take a deep breath through your nose, fill your belly, then release it through your mouth. Release any unconscious tension in your body. Notice the different colors of the room, the sounds, smells, and your other sense perceptions. There is a lot of detail in the present moment. Everything we will ever experience occurs right now. And now... and now... You may smile wondering if this is how dogs also think. Maybe that is why they always look so happy?

## Smile

Your dog seems to always have a smile, and you can too. Even if you fake a smile, it will still benefit you. It is hard to fake a smile and still feel bad. Eventually a fake smile becomes a real smile. Then your smile spreads more smiles, and makes the world a happier place. Give yourself the love your dog gives you, because there is a lot to love about you. Have a wonderful day.
