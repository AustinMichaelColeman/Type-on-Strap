But if you start with imagining yourself exercising, before you know it you will be out the door. Where you are now started at some point with your imagination and now here you are. You could start with a five minute walk. Go outside and enjoy the clouds for a few minutes. Small wins add up and eventually your five minute walk will turn into more.

## Why you should exercise

Exercise improves your mood by helping you feel more energetic. Getting your heartrate up will also help you sleep later that day. Take your frustrations, stress, and anxiety out with a quick run. Stress and anxiety affects a lot of people today. If you get some exercise, you will reduce the world's suffering just a bit because you'll be happier. Then maybe you would encourage another person to exercise and they will be happier too. Soon much of the world is happier, all because you decided to start exercising. The world needs you to exercise.

## How to exercise

You could trot like a horse and bang two coconuts together while reading the [python documentation](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail) to get a more immersive learning experience. Or maybe go for a jog outside for a less silly experience. Back to silly, have you ever done keyboard arm curls? Maybe do it the next time you are reviewing a pull request. Maybe you have some better ideas for getting exercise?
