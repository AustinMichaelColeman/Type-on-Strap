A purely entertaining and informative version of a blog would allow people to be entertained while also learning without going through a literary institution.

Words provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if people fall asleep while reading.

Proof of blog shares knowledge by putting ideas into an ongoing chain of word-based proof of blog, forming a record that can be shared to increase your knowledge and feed your curiosity.

The blog not only serves to increase your knowledge, but proof that it came from a pool of ideas. As long as the majority of posts are not coordinating to attack itself, the blog will continue forming a record to provide knowledge for all.

The blog itself requires minimal maintenence. Blogs are broadcast on a best effort basis, and readers can leave and rejoin the site at will, accepting new blogs as proof of what happened while they were gone.

Thanks for reading!
