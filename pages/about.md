A purely entertaining and informative version of a blog would allow people to be entertained while also learning without going through a literary institution.

Words provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if people fall asleep while reading. So pictures with captions are added to prevent double-sleeping.

Proof of blog shares knowledge by putting ideas into an ongoing chain of word-based proof of blog, forming a record that can be shared to increase your knowledge and feed your curiosity.

The blog not only serves to increase your knowledge, but proof that it came from a pool of ideas. As long as the majority of posts are not coordinating to attack itself, the blog will continue forming a record to provide knowledge for all.

The blog itself requires minimal maintenence. Blogs are broadcast on a best effort basis, and readers can leave and rejoin the site at will, accepting new blogs as proof of what happened while they were gone.

Thanks for reading!
